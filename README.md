# Wonderful-FrontEnd
This is a web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine. It displays a set of cards with dynamic content, where the cards are populated from a JavaScript file. 

The application demonstrates the use of partials in EJS, allowing for a modular and reusable structure. The cards are styled using CSS, with each card having a gradient background effect and an image as the background.

The project showcases the following features:

- Serving static files with Express.js
- Rendering dynamic content using EJS partials
- Passing data from a JavaScript file to the EJS templates
- Styling the cards using CSS, including gradient effects and background images

To run the application, users will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. They can then clone the repository, install the dependencies, and start the server using the provided scripts.

This project was developed as a demonstration of server-side web development using Node.js and Express.js, as well as the use of templating engines like EJS to create dynamic web pages.
